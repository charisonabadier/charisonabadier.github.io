            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>2Market, a global marketplace, wants to understand customer purchasing behaviour, spending patterns and demographics through exploratory analysis.
                The goal of this project is to identify if there are certain trends, correlations, and draw insights to improve customer engagement and create high-impact marketing strategies.</p>

            <h3>Analytical Approach</h3>
            <p>I structured my approach around the three key questions 2Market wanted answered and used both SQL and Excel to explore the data. Each tool offered different advantages, helping me spot patterns and pull out meaningful insights.</p>
            <h4>Data Exploration</h4>
            <p>I grouped my exploration into Demographics and Income, Advertisement Effectiveness, and Product Performance by Demographics.</p>
            
            <h4>In Excel</h4>
            <p>I used dynamic PivotTables and charts, applying tools like Value Field Settings, Group, Sort, Filter, and Show Values As to explore and transform the data.</p>

        <p><strong>The analysis included:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demographics by country, age group, and marital status</li>
            <li>Advertisement effectiveness by response across age groups</li>
            <li>Product performance by demographics and number of kids/teens</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>In SQL</h4>
            <p>I created a database with two tables (<code>marketing_data</code> and <code>ad_data</code>) and joined them for analysis. Using data manipulation language, aggregate functions, and sub-queries, I explored the relationship between advertisement performance and demographic groups at a granular level.</p>

        <p><strong>The analysis included:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertisement effectiveness by response across country and marital status</li>
            <li>Successful leads across countries</li>
            <li>Dominant purchasing channel</li>
        </ul>
            
            

        <h3>Key Findings</h3>

        <p>Based on the analysis, clear patterns were exhibited in customer purchasing and demographic behaviour, along with actionable advertising trends. Spain dominates across all metrics, accounting for 49.34% of the population and total purchases $657,704.00.</p>

        <p>Married individuals contribute $506,885.00 (38.73%) of the spending, emphasizing their importance as a target demographic. The 48-57 age group emerges as the highest spender contributing $391,813.00, with alcohol ($675,350.00) and meat ($369,488.00) being the top-performing products.</p>

        <p>Digital advertisement proved to be effective, driving 57.67% of purchases ($774,794.00). Instagram leads sales, generating $260,009.00 (31.94%). While Spain excels in lead conversions by country (53.03%), Germany (32.76%) and Canada (32.71%) displayed promising regional lead conversions. Conversely, regions like the USA and Australia require further exploration to uncover barriers to engagement.</p>

        <p>While a substantial number of customers responded well to web advertisements, store purchase is dominant across all countries with a difference of 17.36% to web purchase.</p>

        <p>While higher salaries correlate with higher spending, the relationship is not proportional as Graduate level exhibited the highest total spending in contrast with PhD that has an average salary ($56,088.00) higher than Graduate by $3,367.88.</p>

        
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Expand strategy in Spain being the highest-performing country. Capitalize and allocate more resources and leverage its strong lead conversion focusing on digital advertisements.</li>
        <li>Leverage digital advertising, particularly Instagram and consider transitioning to digital brochures.</li>
        <li>Refine product offerings capitalizing on alcohol and meat. Consider introducing product variations to offer more selections.</li>
        <li>Develop campaigns targeting the 48-57 age group and married people to maximize their spending power with focus on alcohol and meat.</li>
    </ul>
