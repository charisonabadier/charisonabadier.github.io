            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>2Market, a global marketplace, wants to understand customer purchasing behaviour, spending patterns and demographics through exploratory analysis.
                The goal of this project is to identify if there are certain trends, correlations, and draw insights to improve customer engagement and create high-impact marketing strategies.</p>

            <h3>Analytical Approach</h3>
            <p>I structured my approach around the three key questions 2Market wanted answered and used both SQL and Excel to explore the data. Each tool offered different advantages, helping me spot patterns and pull out meaningful insights.</p>
            <h4>Data Exploration</h4>
            <p>I grouped my exploration into Demographics and Income, Advertisement Effectiveness, and Product Performance by Demographics.</p>
            
            <h4>In Excel</h4>
            <p>I used dynamic PivotTables and charts, applying tools like Value Field Settings, Group, Sort, Filter, and Show Values As to explore and transform the data.</p>

        <p><strong>The analysis included:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demographics by country, age group, and marital status</li>
            <li>Advertisement effectiveness by response across age groups</li>
            <li>Product performance by demographics and number of kids/teens</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>In SQL</h4>
            <p>I created a database with two tables (<code>marketing_data</code> and <code>ad_data</code>) and joined them for analysis. Using data manipulation language, aggregate functions, and sub-queries, I explored the relationship between advertisement performance and demographic groups at a granular level.</p>

        <p><strong>The analysis included:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertisement effectiveness by response across country and marital status</li>
            <li>Successful leads across countries</li>
            <li>Dominant purchasing channel</li>
        </ul>
